Actual feature requests:

- Author response

This will require the most design effort---the submission page currently
has no UI for this, nor does the review page.  We need to sketch the UI
for both places, and decide on the data model that backs it.

- Multiple submissions per account (done)

This requires a layer of indirection.  Currently, when you visit
writer.html, something happens that directs you to a single submission.
We need to simply not do that, and identify where in the data model the
one-to-one constraint exists (if anywhere).

- Past Review Response Upload

We need to get Robby’s opinion on whether simply using another
submissions component is acceptable here, or we want something more
elaborate.

- Bulletin board

Just a list of comments---this should be straightforward under the
comment tab
