Actual feature requests:

- Author response

This will require the most design effort---the submission page currently has no
UI for this, nor does the review page.  We need to sketch the UI for both
places, and decide on the data model that backs it.

- Multiple submissions per account

This requires a layer of indirection.  Currently, when you visit writer.html,
something happens that directs you to a single submission.  We need to simply
not do that, and identify where in the data model the one-to-one constraint
exists (if anywhere).

- Past Review Response Upload

We need to get Robby’s opinion on whether simply using another submissions
component is acceptable here, or we want something more elaborate.
