To get started:

> cp settings.py.example settings.py

Change settings.py to have relevant paths for your machine.

> mkdir .db
> python manage.py syncdb
> python manage.py test

Everything should pass.

> python setup.py sample

This prints out a launch cap for the admin page.

> python manage.py runserver 9000

Now you can navigate to http://localhost:9000/SC/home, which is the login
portal.
