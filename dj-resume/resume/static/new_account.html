    <p>Welcome to Resume!  While we try to keep the login experience as
painless as possible, we do need to convince ourselves that you are you every
once in a while, and this is one of those times.
</p>

<p> We prefer that you log in with a Google Account, since we'd rather not be
responsible for your password.  However, if you don't have or would rather not
use a Google Account, you can use a username and password specifically for
this service.  If you do, please choose and maintain your username and
password responsibly.
