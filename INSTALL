There are several applications in this repository:

plt-belay
station
apply
resume

-----------
DEVELOPMENT
-----------

You need Django installed: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/

Start the various applications at the right spots:

$ cd dj-apply
$ mkdir .db
$ python manage.py syncdb
$ cp settings.py.example settings.py
# Fidget with settings.py, replacing global paths, etc
$ python manage.py runserver 8001

$ cd dj-resume
$ mkdir .db
$ python manage.py syncdb
$ cp settings.py.example settings.py
# Fidget with settings.py, replacing global paths, etc
$ python manage.py runserver 8003

$ cd dj-plt-belay
$ mkdir .db
$ python manage.py syncdb
$ cp settings.py.example settings.py
# Fidget with settings.py, replacing global paths, etc
$ python manage.py runserver 8000

$ cd dj-plt-station
$ mkdir .db
$ python manage.py syncdb
$ cp settings.py.example settings.py
# Fidget with settings.py, replacing global paths, etc
$ python manage.py runserver 8002


In dj-apply and dj-resume, there are useful scripts called setup.py.  To use
it, run it with a username you want the admin to have (all other parameters,
like department, are hardcoded in setup for now):

$ python setup.py <username>

To get started, go here: http://localhost:8003/static/new_account.html#http://localhost:8003/cap/c54b0234-4ed3-454d-b50c-8239e7f1f572

If you go to that link, you'll be given the opportunity to create an account
(using Google login or making your own account), and you should reach the admin
page.

You can also visit:

http://localhost:8003/cs/

And you can sign up as an applicant, or get back to other accounts that you
have, by going through the right hand pane.

-------
TESTING
-------

Resume and Apply have test suites:

$ cd dj-resume
$ python manage.py test

$ cd dj-apply
$ python manage.py test

Tests are in dj-resume/resume/tests.py and dj-apply/apply/tests.py


Resume and Apply have generate scripts for test data.  You can run generate.py,
or just visit (after adding an entry for generate in urls.py):

http://localhost:8003/generate

----------
PRODUCTION
----------

All of them run on top of Django with a Postgres backend.

  Django is here: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/

  Postgres is here: http://www.postgresql.org/

  PsycoPG connects Django to a Postgres backend:

  (required installing packages python-dev and libpq-dev)
